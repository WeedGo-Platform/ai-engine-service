# Fix for Bilingual Response Leakage and Template Variables

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: English Translations Leaking into Spanish Responses
**Symptom**: 
```
User: "yes can you tell me the time in 2 hours"
Assistant: "¬°Claro! La hora en 2 horas ser√° {time}. (Of course! The time in 2 hours will be {time}.)"
```

The LLM was adding English translations in parentheses after Spanish text, creating a bilingual response format that was confusing and not requested.

**Root Cause**:
The language instruction was:
```python
"CRITICAL: You MUST respond ENTIRELY in Spanish (Espa√±ol). 
The customer wrote in Spanish (Espa√±ol), so all your text must be in Spanish (Espa√±ol)."
```

The LLM interpreted "respond entirely" to mean "respond in Spanish but also be helpful by including English translation." The instruction wasn't explicit enough about NOT adding translations.

### Issue 2: Template Variables Not Being Replaced
**Symptom**:
```
Assistant: "La hora actual es {time}"
```

Instead of actual time value, the LLM was outputting `{time}` as a template variable.

**Root Cause**:
1. **No time tool registered**: The tool_manager.py doesn't have any time-related tools
2. **LLM trying to be helpful**: When asked about time without a tool, the LLM used template variable syntax `{time}` as a placeholder, expecting it to be filled in later by some system
3. **No variable replacement system**: There's no post-processing that replaces template variables in responses

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: More Explicit Language Instructions

**Changed knowledge template path** (line 644-647):
```python
# OLD:
instructions += f"\n6. CRITICAL: You MUST respond ENTIRELY in {language_map[detected_language]}. 
The customer wrote in {language_map[detected_language]}, so all your text must be in {language_map[detected_language]}."

# NEW:
instructions += f"\n6. CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE: Respond ONLY in {language_map[detected_language]}. 
Do NOT add English translations in parentheses. Do NOT include bilingual text. 
The customer speaks {language_map[detected_language]}, so use ONLY {language_map[detected_language]} 
in your entire response."
```

**Changed system prompt path** (line 715-721):
```python
# OLD:
language_instruction = f"\n\nCRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: You MUST respond entirely in 
{language_map[detected_language]}. The user wrote their message in {language_map[detected_language]}, 
so your entire response must be in {language_map[detected_language]}."

# NEW:
language_instruction = f"\n\nCRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE: Respond ONLY in {language_map[detected_language]}. 
Do NOT add English translations in parentheses. Do NOT include bilingual text. 
Do NOT use template variables like {{time}} - provide actual values. 
The user speaks {language_map[detected_language]}, so use ONLY {language_map[detected_language]} 
in your entire response."
```

### Fix 2: Prevent Template Variable Usage

**Added to base instructions** (line 635):
```python
instructions = (
    "\nINSTRUCTIONS: "
    "1. Answer ONLY what the customer asked - don't include unrelated information\n"
    "2. Keep response focused and concise (2-3 short paragraphs maximum)\n"
    "3. Be conversational and friendly, not formal\n"
    "4. End with a specific follow-up question to learn more about their needs\n"
    "5. Do NOT include all pricing tiers unless specifically asked for a comparison\n"
    "6. Do NOT use template variables like {time} or {variable} - provide actual information"  # NEW
)
```

## Key Changes

### Language Instruction Improvements
1. ‚úÖ Changed "MUST respond ENTIRELY" ‚Üí "Respond ONLY" (clearer directive)
2. ‚úÖ Added explicit "Do NOT add English translations in parentheses"
3. ‚úÖ Added explicit "Do NOT include bilingual text"
4. ‚úÖ Changed "The customer wrote in X" ‚Üí "The customer speaks X" (present tense, ongoing state)
5. ‚úÖ Added "so use ONLY {language}" at the end for emphasis

### Template Variable Prevention
1. ‚úÖ Added instruction to system prompt: "Do NOT use template variables like {time}"
2. ‚úÖ Added to base instructions: "Do NOT use template variables - provide actual information"
3. ‚úÖ Emphasized "provide actual values" instead of placeholders

## Expected Results

### Before:
```
User: "hola amigo, puedes decirme la hora?"
Assistant: "¬°Claro! La hora actual es {time}. (Of course! The current time is {time}.)"
```

### After:
```
User: "hola amigo, puedes decirme la hora?"
Assistant: "¬°Claro! No puedo ver la hora exacta en este momento, pero puedo ayudarte con otra informaci√≥n. ¬øHay algo m√°s en lo que pueda asistirte?"
```

Or if a time tool is added in the future:
```
User: "hola amigo, puedes decirme la hora?"
Assistant: "¬°Claro! Son las 10:15 AM. ¬øNecesitas saber algo m√°s?"
```

## Notes on Time Tool

The system currently **does NOT have a time tool**. Options for handling time queries:

### Option 1: Add Time Tool (Recommended)
Create `/Backend/services/tools/time_tool.py`:
```python
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

class TimeTool:
    def get_current_time(self, timezone='UTC'):
        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
        return datetime.now(tz).strftime('%I:%M %p')
    
    def get_time_in_hours(self, hours, timezone='UTC'):
        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
        future_time = datetime.now(tz) + timedelta(hours=hours)
        return future_time.strftime('%I:%M %p')
```

Register in `tool_manager.py`:
```python
self.register_tool(
    "get_time",
    self._create_time_tool,
    {"description": "Get current time or future time", "category": "utility"}
)
```

### Option 2: Let LLM Admit It Can't Access Time
With the current fix, the LLM will say something like:
- "I don't have access to real-time clock information"
- "I can't check the current time, but I can help with other questions"

This is honest and avoids the template variable issue.

## Files Modified
- `/Backend/services/agent_pool_manager.py` - Lines 635, 644-647, 715-721
  - Made language instructions more explicit
  - Added template variable prevention
  - Strengthened NO bilingual text rule

## Testing

Test these scenarios:

1. **Spanish greeting**:
   - Input: "hola amigo"
   - Expected: Response in Spanish only, no parentheses with English

2. **Time query**:
   - Input: "can you tell me the time"
   - Expected: Either actual time (if tool added) OR honest "I can't access time" message
   - NOT expected: "{time}" variable

3. **Spanish time query**:
   - Input: "puedes decirme la hora"
   - Expected: Spanish-only response, no {time} variable, no English in parentheses

4. **Language consistency**:
   - Input: "hola" ‚Üí "gracias" ‚Üí "perfecto"
   - Expected: All responses in Spanish, no language mixing

## Console Logs to Watch

```
üåê Direct language detection: 'hola amigo' ‚Üí es
üåê Multilingual: Detected Spanish (Espa√±ol), adding language requirement to instructions
```

Ensure no responses contain:
- ‚ùå `(English translation here)`
- ‚ùå `{time}` or `{variable}`
- ‚ùå Mixed Spanish and English in same response
