## ðŸ”§ Configuration Steps (Required)

### 1. Stripe Account Setup

- [ ] Create Stripe account at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
- [ ] Verify email and business details
- [ ] Enable Canadian currency (CAD) support
- [ ] Get test API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
- [ ] Get production API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys (later)

### 2. Create Products and Prices in Stripe

**Option A: Using Stripe Dashboard**

- [ ] Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
- [ ] Create "WeedGo Professional Plan" product
  - [ ] Add monthly price: $199.00 CAD, recurring monthly
  - [ ] Add quarterly price: $537.00 CAD, recurring every 3 months
  - [ ] Add annual price: $1,990.00 CAD, recurring yearly
  - [ ] Copy all 3 price IDs
- [ ] Create "WeedGo Enterprise Plan" product
  - [ ] Add monthly price: $499.00 CAD, recurring monthly
  - [ ] Add quarterly price: $1,347.00 CAD, recurring every 3 months
  - [ ] Add annual price: $4,990.00 CAD, recurring yearly
  - [ ] Copy all 3 price IDs

**Option B: Using Stripe CLI** (faster)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
stripe login

# Run the automated setup script (see STRIPE_QUICK_START.md)
# This creates products and prints price IDs
```

### 3. Update Code with Price IDs

- [ ] Open `src/Backend/api/subscription_endpoints.py`
- [ ] Find `SUBSCRIPTION_PRICING` dictionary (around line 75)
- [ ] Replace placeholder price IDs with actual Stripe price IDs:
  ```python
  "professional": {
      "stripe_price_id": {
          "monthly": "price_XXXXX",    # Replace with actual ID
          "quarterly": "price_XXXXX",  # Replace with actual ID
          "annual": "price_XXXXX"      # Replace with actual ID
      },
  }
  ```
- [ ] Save file

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

- [ ] Create or update `.env` file in project root:
  ```bash
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  STRIPE_ENVIRONMENT=test
  ```
- [ ] Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore` (NEVER commit API keys)

### 5. Set Up Webhooks

**For Local Development:**

- [ ] Install Stripe CLI: `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`
- [ ] Run webhook forwarder: `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/stripe`
- [ ] Copy webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)
- [ ] Add to `.env` as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**For Production:**

- [ ] Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- [ ] Click "Add endpoint"
- [ ] Endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- [ ] Select events:
  - [ ] `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - [ ] `invoice.payment_failed`
  - [ ] `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - [ ] `customer.subscription.updated`
  - [ ] `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
- [ ] Click "Add endpoint"
- [ ] Copy webhook signing secret
- [ ] Add to production environment as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 6. Register API Routes

- [ ] Open `src/Backend/main.py` (or your main FastAPI app file)
- [ ] Add imports:
  ```python
  from api.subscription_endpoints import router as subscription_router
  from webhooks.stripe_webhooks import router as webhook_router
  ```
- [ ] Register routers:
  ```python
  app.include_router(subscription_router)
  app.include_router(webhook_router)
  ```
- [ ] Save file

### 7. Database Setup

- [ ] Verify `tenant_subscriptions` table exists
- [ ] Run index creation if needed:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tenant_subscriptions_tenant_id ON tenant_subscriptions(tenant_id);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tenant_subscriptions_status ON tenant_subscriptions(status);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tenant_subscriptions_stripe_sub_id ON tenant_subscriptions((metadata->>'stripe_subscription_id'));
  ```

## ðŸ§ª Testing (Required Before Production)

### 1. Start Server and Webhook Listener

Terminal 1 - Webhook Forwarder:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

Terminal 2 - Application Server:
```bash
cd src/Backend
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. Test Subscription Creation

- [ ] Run test API call:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/subscriptions/create \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "tenant_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "plan_tier": "professional",
      "billing_frequency": "monthly",
      "customer_email": "test@example.com",
      "customer_name": "Test Company",
      "trial_days": 14
    }'
  ```

- [ ] Verify response contains:
  - `subscription_id`
  - `status: "trialing"`
  - `stripe_subscription_id`
  - `trial_end_date` (14 days from now)

- [ ] Check Stripe dashboard:
  - [ ] Customer created
  - [ ] Subscription created with trial
  - [ ] Status shows "trialing"

### 3. Test Payment Success

- [ ] Trigger payment success webhook:
  ```bash
  stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
  ```

- [ ] Check logs for:
  - "Processing Stripe webhook: invoice.payment_succeeded"
  - "Recording successful payment for subscription..."
  - "Subscription renewed until..."

- [ ] Verify in database:
  ```sql
  SELECT status, payment_status, next_billing_date 
  FROM tenant_subscriptions 
  WHERE tenant_id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000';
  ```

### 4. Test Payment Failure

- [ ] Trigger payment failure webhook:
  ```bash
  stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
  ```

- [ ] Check logs for:
  - "Payment failed for subscription..."
  - "Subscription marked as PAST_DUE"

- [ ] Verify status changed to `past_due` in database

### 5. Test Subscription Upgrade

- [ ] Get subscription ID from creation response
- [ ] Run upgrade API call:
  ```bash
  curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/upgrade \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"new_tier": "enterprise"}'
  ```

- [ ] Verify response shows new tier and price
- [ ] Check Stripe dashboard shows updated subscription

### 6. Test Subscription Cancellation

- [ ] Run cancellation API call:
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/cancel \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "cancel_immediately": false,
      "reason": "Testing cancellation"
    }'
  ```

- [ ] Verify response shows cancellation scheduled
- [ ] Check Stripe dashboard shows "Cancels at period end"
