## 📊 Test Suite Overview

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 20+ comprehensive tests
- **Coverage Target**: >80% for critical paths
- **Execution Time**:
  - Unit tests: <2 minutes
  - Integration tests: <5 minutes
  - Concurrency tests: <3 minutes
  - All tests: <10 minutes

### Test Categories

#### 1. **Concurrency Tests** (MOST CRITICAL)
**Purpose**: Prove cart locking prevents race conditions

**Location**: `tests/concurrency/test_cart_locking.py`

**What It Tests**:
- ✅ Double checkout prevention (same cart, multiple tabs)
- ✅ Inventory overselling prevention
- ✅ Lock acquisition order (FIFO)
- ✅ Lock timeout handling
- ✅ Automatic lock release on errors
- ✅ Price manipulation prevention
- ✅ High concurrency stress (50 simultaneous requests)

**Run Concurrency Tests**:
```bash
./run_tests.sh concurrency
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ PASS: Cart locking successfully prevented double checkout
✅ PASS: Inventory validation prevented overselling
✅ PASS: All requests completed in order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
✅ PASS: Lock timeout works correctly
✅ PASS: Lock automatically released on error
✅ PASS: Server-side pricing prevented manipulation
✅ PASS: System handled 50 concurrent requests
```

#### 2. **Integration Tests**
**Purpose**: Test complete checkout flow with all components

**Location**: `tests/integration/test_checkout_flow.py`

**What It Tests**:
- ✅ Complete delivery checkout flow
- ✅ Complete pickup checkout flow
- ✅ Promo code application
- ✅ Insufficient inventory handling
- ✅ Cart session conversion
- ✅ Order status history
- ✅ Payment method validation

**Run Integration Tests**:
```bash
./run_tests.sh integration
```

#### 3. **Unit Tests**
**Purpose**: Test individual functions in isolation

**Location**: `tests/unit/`

**Run Unit Tests**:
```bash
./run_tests.sh unit
```

## 🔥 Proof of Cart Locking Implementation

### Test 1: Double Checkout Prevention

**Scenario**: User clicks "Place Order" twice (or has 2 tabs open)

**Code**:
```python
async def test_cart_lock_prevents_double_checkout():
    # Launch 3 concurrent checkout attempts
    await asyncio.gather(
        attempt_checkout(1),
        attempt_checkout(2),
        attempt_checkout(3)
    )

    # ASSERTION: Only ONE succeeds
    assert len(successful) == 1
    assert len(failed) == 2
```

**Result**:
```
Attempt 1: Lock acquired → SUCCESS
Attempt 2: Lock timeout (EXPECTED) → BLOCKED
Attempt 3: Lock timeout (EXPECTED) → BLOCKED
```

**Proof**: Cart locking works! Only 1 order created.

---

### Test 2: Inventory Overselling Prevention

**Scenario**: 3 users buy same limited item (only 10 available, each wants 5)

**Code**:
```python
async def test_inventory_overselling_prevention():
    # Set inventory: 10 available
    # 3 users want: 5 each = 15 total

    # Launch concurrent purchases
    await asyncio.gather(
        attempt_purchase(cart1, user1),
        attempt_purchase(cart2, user2),
        attempt_purchase(cart3, user3)
    )

    # ASSERTION: Only 2 succeed (10/5=2)
    assert len(successful) == 2
    assert len(failed) == 1
```

**Result**:
```
User 1: Reserved 5 items → SUCCESS (5 left)
User 2: Reserved 5 items → SUCCESS (0 left)
User 3: Insufficient stock → FAILED ❌
Final inventory: 0 available ✓
```

**Proof**: No overselling! Inventory accounting is correct.

---

### Test 3: Price Manipulation Prevention

**Scenario**: Attacker modifies client-side price before checkout

**Code**:
```python
async def test_concurrent_price_manipulation_prevented():
    # User submits cart with MANIPULATED price
    manipulated_price = 1.00  # Real price: $19.99

    # Server recalculates from inventory
    calculated_pricing = await pricing_service.calculate_order_totals(...)

    # ASSERTION: Server uses REAL price
    assert calculated_pricing['subtotal'] == 19.99 * 2
```

**Result**:
```
Client sent: $1.00 per item
Server used: $19.99 per item (from inventory)
Order total: $39.98 (2 items × $19.99)
```

**Proof**: Price manipulation prevented!

## 🏃 Running Tests

### Method 1: Using Test Runner Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Quick sanity check (unit + smoke tests)
./run_tests.sh fast

# CRITICAL tests only (concurrency + security)
./run_tests.sh critical

# All tests with coverage report
./run_tests.sh all coverage

# Specific test type
./run_tests.sh concurrency
./run_tests.sh integration
./run_tests.sh unit
```

### Method 2: Direct pytest Commands

```bash
# Run concurrency tests with verbose output
pytest tests/concurrency/ -v -m concurrency

# Run specific test
pytest tests/concurrency/test_cart_locking.py::test_cart_lock_prevents_double_checkout -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
