Payment Processing V2 Endpoints
DDD-Powered Payment API using Payment Processing Bounded Context

This endpoint demonstrates the DDD integration pattern:
- Uses PaymentTransaction aggregate from domain layer
- Implements Command/Query separation
- Publishes domain events
- Returns clean DTOs (not domain objects)
- Full backward compatibility with V1
