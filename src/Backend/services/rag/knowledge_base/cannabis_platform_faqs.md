# Cannabis & Platform FAQs - Comprehensive Knowledge Base

## Cannabis Basics

### What is cannabis?
Cannabis is a plant that contains compounds called cannabinoids, primarily THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). THC is the psychoactive compound that produces the "high" feeling, while CBD is non-intoxicating and may have therapeutic benefits.

### What's the difference between indica, sativa, and hybrid strains?
- **Indica**: Typically associated with relaxing, sedating effects. Often chosen for evening use or pain relief.
- **Sativa**: Generally linked to energizing, uplifting effects. Often preferred for daytime use or social activities.
- **Hybrid**: A mix of indica and sativa genetics, offering balanced effects or specific characteristics from both types.

Note: Modern research suggests effects depend more on specific cannabinoid and terpene profiles than strain classification alone.

### What are terpenes?
Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in cannabis and other plants. They contribute to the plant's smell and flavor, and may also influence effects. Common terpenes include:
- **Myrcene**: Earthy, musky aroma - may enhance relaxation
- **Limonene**: Citrus scent - may improve mood
- **Pinene**: Pine aroma - may enhance alertness
- **Linalool**: Floral scent - may promote calmness
- **Caryophyllene**: Spicy, peppery - may help with stress

### What's the difference between THC and CBD?
- **THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)**: The primary psychoactive compound that produces euphoria, altered perception, and the "high" feeling. May help with pain, nausea, and appetite.
- **CBD (Cannabidiol)**: Non-intoxicating compound that doesn't produce a high. May help with anxiety, inflammation, seizures, and pain without psychoactive effects.

### What are cannabinoids?
Cannabinoids are chemical compounds found in cannabis that interact with the body's endocannabinoid system. The two main cannabinoids are THC and CBD, but there are over 100 others including CBG, CBN, THCV, and CBC.

### How do I choose the right cannabis product?
Consider these factors:
1. **Desired effects**: Relaxation, energy, pain relief, sleep aid
2. **THC/CBD ratio**: Higher THC for psychoactive effects, higher CBD for therapeutic benefits without intoxication
3. **Consumption method**: Smoking, vaping, edibles, oils, topicals
4. **Tolerance level**: Start low and go slow, especially if you're new
5. **Time of use**: Sativa/energizing for day, indica/relaxing for evening

### What does "start low and go slow" mean?
This is the golden rule for cannabis consumption, especially for beginners:
- Start with products that have lower THC content (5-10mg for edibles, 10-15% for flower)
- Wait before consuming more - edibles can take 30 minutes to 2 hours to take effect
- Increase dosage gradually over multiple sessions
- Give your body time to adjust and understand your tolerance

### What are the different methods of consumption?
- **Smoking**: Immediate effects (minutes), lasts 1-3 hours
- **Vaping**: Quick onset (minutes), slightly longer lasting than smoking, potentially less harsh
- **Edibles**: Delayed onset (30min-2hr), longer lasting (4-8hr), more intense effects
- **Oils/Tinctures**: Sublingual (under tongue) onset in 15-45min, lasts 4-6 hours
- **Topicals**: Localized relief, no psychoactive effects, onset within 15-30min

### How long do cannabis effects last?
- **Smoking/Vaping**: Peak at 10-30min, total duration 1-3 hours
- **Edibles**: Peak at 2-4 hours, total duration 4-8+ hours
- **Oils (sublingual)**: Peak at 1-2 hours, total duration 4-6 hours
- **Topicals**: Effects can last 2-4 hours

## Product Information

### What information is in the OCS product catalog?

### How accurate is THC/CBD content?
THC and CBD content is tested by licensed laboratories and reported as ranges (minimum to maximum percentages). Actual content may vary slightly between batches due to natural plant variation. Always check the product label for the most current test results.

### What does "equivalency" mean for edibles?
Cannabis regulations use THC equivalency to standardize dosing:
- 1 gram of dried cannabis = 5mg of THC in edibles
- This helps consumers understand dosing across different product types
- The maximum THC per package for edibles is 10mg in Canada

### How should I store cannabis products?
- **Dried flower**: Cool, dark, airtight container - avoid humidity extremes
- **Edibles**: Follow package instructions, often refrigeration after opening
