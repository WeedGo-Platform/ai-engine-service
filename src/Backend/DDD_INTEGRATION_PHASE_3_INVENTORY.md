### 3. Main Server Registration (`api_server.py`)

Registered Inventory V2 router in main server:

```python
# V2 Inventory endpoints (DDD-powered)
try:
    from api.v2.inventory import router as inventory_v2_router
    app.include_router(inventory_v2_router, prefix="/api")
    logger.info("✅ Inventory V2 (DDD) endpoints loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to load Inventory V2 endpoints: {e}")
```

**Location:** Lines 531-537

---

### 4. V1 Compatibility Notice (`api/inventory_endpoints.py`)

Added migration notice to V1 inventory endpoints:

```python
"""
Inventory Management API Endpoints (V1 - Production)

⚠️ MIGRATION NOTICE:
This is the V1 inventory API, currently in production use.
A new V2 API using DDD architecture is available at /api/v2/inventory/*

V2 advantages:
- Domain-Driven Design with Inventory aggregate
- Rich business rule validation
- Stock level management with automatic status calculation
- Reserve/release operations for order fulfillment
- Better separation of concerns
- Event sourcing ready
- Pricing and margin calculations
"""
```

- `create()` - Factory method for new inventory items
- `reserve_stock()` - Reserve quantity for orders
- `release_stock()` - Release reserved quantity
- `receive_stock()` - Add stock from suppliers
- `consume_stock()` - Fulfill reservations
- `adjust_stock()` - Manual adjustments with reason
- `update_cost()` - Update unit cost
- `update_retail_price()` - Update retail price
- `set_dynamic_price()` - Set promotional price
- `update_reorder_levels()` - Configure reorder thresholds
- `perform_cycle_count()` - Physical count with variance
- `get_stock_status()` - Calculate current status

### StockLevel Value Object

**Immutable value object with:**
- Quantity tracking (on_hand, available, reserved)
- Status calculation logic
- Reserve/release operations (return new instances)
- Validation in `__post_init__`

### Domain Events

**Published by Inventory aggregate:**
- `InventoryCreated` - New item created
- `StockAdjusted` - Manual adjustment
- `StockReserved` - Stock reserved for order
- `StockReleased` - Reservation released
- `StockReceived` - Stock received from supplier
- `StockConsumed` - Reservation fulfilled
- `LowStockAlert` - Below reorder point
- `PricingUpdated` - Prices changed
- `ReorderLevelsUpdated` - Thresholds changed
- `CycleCountPerformed` - Physical count completed

## Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Clean Architecture
```
Domain Layer (Inventory aggregate)
    ↓ (uses)
Application Layer (InventoryService - future)
    ↓ (uses)
Infrastructure Layer (Repository - future)
    ↓ (uses)
API Layer (Inventory V2 endpoints)
```

### 2. CQRS Pattern
- **Commands:** Create, adjust, reserve, release, receive, consume, update pricing
- **Queries:** List, get details, low stock, valuation, stats
- Separate read and write models

### 3. Event Sourcing Ready
- All mutations publish domain events
- Events tracked in aggregate
- Ready for event store integration

### 4. Repository Pattern (Commented)
```python
# In real implementation:
# inventory = await repository.get_by_id(inventory_id)
# inventory.reserve_stock(quantity, reservation_id)
# await repository.save(inventory)
```

### 5. Dependency Injection
```python
async def adjust_stock(
    inventory_id: str,
    request: AdjustStockRequest,
    current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)
):
```

## Business Rules Enforced

### Stock Management:
1. ✅ Cannot reserve more than available quantity
2. ✅ Cannot adjust to negative quantities
3. ✅ Quantity on hand = available + reserved
4. ✅ Stock status automatically calculated

### Pricing:
1. ✅ Prices cannot be negative
2. ✅ Margin calculated from cost and retail
3. ✅ Effective price = dynamic_price or retail_price
4. ✅ Dynamic pricing overrides retail price

### Reorder Levels:
1. ✅ Reorder point ≤ max stock level
2. ✅ Min stock level ≤ reorder point
3. ✅ Alert triggered when quantity ≤ reorder point
4. ✅ Overstocked when quantity > max level

### Cycle Counting:
1. ✅ Must record counter ID for audit
2. ✅ Variance = counted - system quantity
3. ✅ Stock automatically adjusted to match count
4. ✅ Audit trail preserved

## ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────

**Why Inventory Management is Complex:**

1. **State Transitions:** Stock can be in multiple states (available, reserved, consumed), requiring careful state management to prevent race conditions.

2. **Consistency Boundaries:** The Inventory aggregate ensures that `quantity_on_hand = quantity_available + quantity_reserved` is always true, demonstrating the aggregate pattern's value.

3. **Immutable Value Objects:** StockLevel is immutable, meaning every reserve/release operation creates a new StockLevel instance. This prevents bugs from shared mutable state.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Publishing domain events (StockReserved, LowStockAlert) enables reactive systems - other contexts can subscribe and react without tight coupling.

5. **Business Logic in Domain:** Calculations like margin percentage, stock status, and reorder flags live in the domain model, not the API layer, making them reusable and testable.

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully demonstrates the DDD integration pattern with the most complex context so far:

- **15 endpoints** covering full inventory lifecycle
- **Stock state management** with reserve/release operations
- **Pricing and valuation** calculations
- **Reorder automation** with alerts
- **Cycle counting** for physical audits
- **356 lines of DTOs** for clean separation
- **720 lines of endpoints** with comprehensive business rules

The Inventory context showcases how DDD handles complex state machines (stock states), calculated fields (margin, status), and business rules (reorder logic) in a maintainable, testable way.

Ready to proceed with Phase 4: Product Catalog Management! 🚀
