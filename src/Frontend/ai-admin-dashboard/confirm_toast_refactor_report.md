# Confirm Toast Refactoring Report

- Total files processed: 123
- Files updated: 3

## Changes Made

1. Replaced `confirm()` and `window.confirm()` with `confirmToastAsync()`
2. Added `async` keyword to functions that use `await confirmToastAsync()`
3. Added import for `confirmToastAsync` from ConfirmToast component

## Important Notes

- Functions containing `await` have been made `async`
- You may need to add `async` to parent functions if they call these functions
- The confirmToastAsync returns a Promise<boolean>
- Toast appears at top-center with custom styling

## Next Steps

1. Test all confirmation dialogs
2. Verify async/await chain is complete
3. Check that parent functions handle the Promise correctly
4. Update TypeScript types if needed
