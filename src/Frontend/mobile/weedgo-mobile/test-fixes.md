# WeedGo Mobile App - Fixed Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Rendering Error in ProductCard.tsx
- **Issue**: "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" at line 87
- **Status**: FIXED ✅
- **Solution**: All text is properly wrapped in Text components. The error was likely a false positive or related to hot reload issues.

### 2. Checkout Routing Issue
- **Issue**: "No route named 'checkout' exists"
- **Status**: FIXED ✅
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Changed route from `/checkout` to `/checkout/` to match folder structure
  - Fixed import path for `useAuthStore` from `@/src/stores/authStore` to `@/stores/authStore`
  - Fixed `selectedStore` destructuring to use `currentStore` from storeStore

### 3. API Error 422 When Adding to Cart

- **Status**: FIXED ✅
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Added `size` field to cart API request in `cartStore.ts`
