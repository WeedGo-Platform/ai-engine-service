**Status**: In Progress

## Summary

Comprehensive review of the mobile checkout flow implementation identifying critical bugs and inconsistencies that prevent successful order placement.

## 🐛 Critical Bugs

### 1. AddressSection Field Name Mismatch
**Severity**: HIGH
**Location**: `components/checkout/AddressSection.tsx:290-380`

**Issue**:
The `QuickAddressForm` component uses different field names than the main address form, creating a type mismatch that will cause validation failures and API errors.

**Current State**:
```typescript
// QuickAddressForm uses:
{
  street: '',           // ❌ Wrong
  unit: '',             // ❌ Wrong
  city: '',             // ✅ Correct
  province: 'ON',       // ❌ Wrong
  postal_code: '',      // ✅ Correct
  instructions: '',     // ❌ Wrong
}

// Main form expects (DeliveryAddress type):
{
  street_address: '',   // ✅ Correct
  unit_number: '',      // ✅ Correct
  city: '',             // ✅ Correct
  province_state: 'ON', // ✅ Correct
  postal_code: '',      // ✅ Correct
  delivery_instructions: '', // ✅ Correct
  address_type: 'delivery',
}
```

**Impact**:
- First-time users see the QuickAddressForm
- Form submission fails silently or with validation errors
- Users cannot complete checkout
- Poor UX for new user onboarding

**Fix Required**:
Update QuickAddressForm state to match DeliveryAddress interface.

### 2. WebSocket Endpoint Not Registered (Suspected)
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Location**: `src/Backend/api/delivery_endpoints.py` and `src/Backend/main_server.py`

**Issue**:
The WebSocket delivery tracking endpoint exists (`/api/v1/delivery/ws/{delivery_id}`) but may not be properly registered in the main FastAPI application.

**Current State**:
- WebSocket endpoint defined: `/api/v1/delivery/ws/{delivery_id}` ✅
- Mobile app connects to: `ws://localhost:5024/api/v1/delivery/ws/{deliveryId}` ✅
- Registration status: **UNKNOWN** ⚠️

**Impact**:
- Real-time delivery tracking doesn't work
- Users cannot see live driver location
- ETA updates fail to arrive
- Connection errors in mobile app

**Verification Needed**:
Check if `delivery_endpoints.py` router is included in `main_server.py`

---

## ⚠️ Medium Severity Issues

### 3. Payment Method Type Safety
**Location**: `components/checkout/PaymentSection.tsx`

**Issue**:
Payment methods are filtered with `.filter((payment) => payment != null)` suggesting null values exist in the array, but TypeScript type doesn't reflect this.

**Impact**:
- Potential runtime errors if null payment methods slip through
- Type safety compromised

**Recommendation**:
Update TypeScript type to `Array<PaymentMethod | null>` or ensure store never returns null.

### 4. TODO Comments in Production Code
**Location**: Multiple files

**Instances**:
1. `app/checkout.tsx:257` - Time picker modal not implemented
2. `app/checkout.tsx:302` - Text input modal not implemented
3. `components/checkout/PaymentSection.tsx:92-119` - Card payment integration pending

**Impact**:
- Pickup time selection uses placeholder
- Special instructions uses Alert.prompt (iOS only)
- Card payments redirect to cash

**Status**: Known limitations, documented with TODOs
