## 🎯 Mission

Transform the payment system from **87.5% complete** to **100% production-ready** by addressing critical gaps in frontend-backend integration, state management, and error handling while maintaining the excellent DDD architecture already in place.

---

## 🚦 Current Status

### ✅ **What's Working Well (87.5%)**

**Backend Excellence:**
- ✨ **World-class DDD implementation** with proper aggregates, value objects, and domain events
- ✨ **Multi-provider support** (Clover, Moneris, Interac) with clean abstractions
- ✨ **Comprehensive V2 API** with proper schemas and validation
- ✨ **Production-ready database migrations** with rollback support
- ✨ **Store-level provider management** for operational flexibility

**Frontend Strengths:**
- ✨ **Feature-rich UI components** with excellent UX design
- ✨ **Complete i18n** support for 28 languages
- ✨ **Comprehensive payment management** pages and modals
- ✨ **Transaction filtering and search** functionality

### ❌ **Critical Gaps (12.5%)**

**The Blockers:**
1. 🔴 **API Version Mismatch** - Frontend calls V1, backend serves V2
2. 🔴 **Mock Data in Production** - TenantPaymentSettings uses hardcoded data
3. 🔴 **No State Management** - Duplicate API calls, poor performance
4. 🔴 **Missing Error Boundaries** - App crashes propagate
5. 🔴 **No Idempotency Keys** - Risk of duplicate payments

**Impact:** System is **NOT production-ready** due to these blockers.

## 📅 Timeline

### High-Level Roadmap

```
Week 1-2  │ ████████ Phase 1: API Migration & State Management
Week 3-4  │ ████████ Phase 1: Error Handling & Idempotency
Week 5-6  │ ████████ Phase 2: Provider Management UI
Week 7-8  │ ████████ Phase 2: Webhooks & Export
Week 9-10 │ ████████ Phase 3: Testing & QA
Week 11-13│ ████████ Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)
Week 14   │ ████████ Production Deployment
```

### Milestones

| Milestone | Date | Deliverable |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| M1: Foundation Fixed | End Sprint 2 | Can process real payments |
| M2: Features Complete | End Sprint 4 | Full CRUD + webhooks |
| M3: Testing Done | End Sprint 5 | >85% coverage |
| M4: Production Ready | End Sprint 7 | All features operational |

### Critical Path

**Must complete in order:**
1. API V2 Migration (Blocker for everything else)
2. State Management (Blocker for UI features)
3. Error Handling (Blocker for production)
4. Provider Management (Blocker for self-service)

**Can parallelize:**

## 💰 Effort Estimation

### By Phase

| Phase | Duration | Team Size | Total Person-Weeks |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-4 weeks | 2 FE + 1 BE | 6-12 person-weeks |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 weeks | 2 FE + 2 BE | 16-24 person-weeks |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | 1 FE + 1 BE + 1 QA | 6-9 person-weeks |
| Phase 4 | 4-6 weeks | 2 FE + 1 BE | 12-18 person-weeks |
| **Total** | **12-19 weeks** | **~3 people** | **40-63 person-weeks** |

### By Priority

| Priority | Tasks | Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 🔴 P0 (Blockers) | 5 | 9-14 days | None |
| 🟠 P1 (Critical) | 3 | 10-15 days | P0 complete |
| 🟡 P2 (High) | 1 | 10-15 days | P1 complete |
| 🟢 P3 (Medium) | 2 | 16-24 days | P2 complete |

### Minimum Viable Production (MVP)

**Scope:** P0 + P1 only
**Duration:** 6-8 weeks
**Effort:** 26-39 person-weeks
**Team:** 2 FE + 2 BE + 1 QA

This gets you a **production-ready payment system** without advanced features.
