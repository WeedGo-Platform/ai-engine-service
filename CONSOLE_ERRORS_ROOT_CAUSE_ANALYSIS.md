## Error Pattern Analysis

### Console Log Sequence
```
1. :5024/api/checkout/check-user/charrcy%40gmail.com:1  Failed (404)
2. auth.ts?t=1761177750321:81 Email check failed
3. :5024/api/auth/me:1  Failed (404) [OLD ENDPOINT]
4. Profile.tsx:105 Failed to load user data (x2)
5. :5024/api/v1/auth/customer/me:1  Failed (403) [NEW ENDPOINT]
6. hook.js:608 Failed to load user data (x2)
```

## Root Cause: Browser Cache + Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Issue

### Primary Cause
The browser is running with **multiple versions of the code simultaneously** due to Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) mechanism:

1. **Cached Version**: Browser has cached the OLD auth.ts with `/api/auth/me`
2. **Updated Version**: HMR loaded the NEW auth.ts with `/api/v1/auth/customer/me`
3. **Both Execute**: Both versions are running, causing duplicate API calls

### Evidence
- `auth.ts?t=1761177750321` - The timestamp parameter indicates Vite's cache-busting
- Duplicate error messages for "Failed to load user data"
- Both old and new endpoints being called sequentially
- Profile.tsx making calls twice (lines 105 appear twice in errors)

## Why This Happens

### 1. Vite HMR Partial Update
When you edit `auth.ts`, Vite tries to hot-reload just that module:
- Old module instances may remain in memory
- New module loads alongside the old one
- React components using the service get confused

### 2. Module Resolution Cache
```javascript
// Old cached instance
import { authApi } from './api/auth'; // Points to old version

// New HMR instance
import { authApi } from './api/auth?t=1761177750321'; // New version
```

### 3. React Component Re-renders
Profile.tsx likely:
1. Renders with old authApi instance → calls `/api/auth/me` → 404
2. Re-renders with new authApi instance → calls `/api/v1/auth/customer/me` → 403

## Error Breakdown

### 404 Errors (Old Endpoints)
- `/api/checkout/check-user/charrcy@gmail.com` - Old code still running
- `/api/auth/me` - Cached auth.ts version

### 403 Errors (New Endpoints - Expected)
- `/api/v1/auth/customer/me` - Correct endpoint, user not authenticated
- This is EXPECTED behavior when not logged in

## Solution Required

### Immediate Fix
1. **Full Page Refresh**: Force browser to reload all modules
   ```
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Clear browser cache and reload
   ```

2. **Restart Vite Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
   # Restart it
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Clear Vite Cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   npm run dev
   ```

## Why Both Endpoints Execute

### Component Lifecycle
```typescript
// Profile.tsx useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  loadUserData(); // First call with cached authApi
}, []);

// After HMR update
useEffect(() => {
  loadUserData(); // Second call with new authApi
}, [/* dependency changed by HMR */]);
```

### Module Replacement Timeline
1. T0: Page loads with old auth.ts
2. T1: User edits auth.ts
3. T2: Vite injects new module
4. T3: Components re-render
5. T4: Both old and new API calls execute

## Verification Steps

### Check Current Code State
1. The auth.ts file HAS been updated correctly:
   - `/api/auth/me` → `/api/v1/auth/customer/me` ✅
   - `/api/checkout/check-user/{email}` is correct ✅

2. The backend IS working correctly:
   - Guest checkout returns 200 ✅
   - Customer/me returns 403 (auth required) ✅

### The Real Issue
**It's NOT a code problem** - it's a development environment caching issue.

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Always restart Vite** after changing API endpoints
2. **Clear browser cache** when seeing duplicate calls
3. **Use incognito/private browsing** for testing API changes
4. **Check Network tab** to verify which version is being called

### For Production
This issue ONLY occurs in development with HMR enabled.
Production builds will not have this problem because:
- No HMR in production
- Single bundled version
- No module replacement

## Summary

**Not a bug in the code** - it's a development environment artifact caused by:
1. Vite's Hot Module Replacement keeping old modules in memory
2. Browser caching old versions with timestamp query parameters
3. React components re-rendering with both old and new module instances

**The fixes applied to the code are correct** - the console errors are from the browser running both old (cached) and new (HMR-updated) versions simultaneously.
