# Phase 1.12: Integration Testing Checklist

**Status:** In Progress
**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Goal:** Verify Phase 1 components work together before moving to Phase 2
**Approach:** Manual testing + documentation (automated tests in Phase 3)

---

## Testing Approach

Since we're between Phase 1 (Foundation) and Phase 2 (Features), we'll do **pragmatic manual integration testing** to:
1. ✅ Verify the UI loads without errors
2. ✅ Test API connectivity (V2 endpoints)
3. ✅ Document what works and what doesn't
4. ✅ Identify blockers for Phase 2

**Note:** Automated test suites (pytest, Playwright) will be created in Phase 3.

**Status:** [ ] Not Tested | [ ] Passed | [ ] Failed

**Notes:**
```
/api/v2/payments:
/api/v2/payments/stats:
```

---

### 2.3 Frontend → Backend Connectivity ✅

**Test:** Verify frontend can reach backend

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools (Network tab)
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/payments` with a store selected
3. Check Network tab for API calls

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ API calls to `http://localhost:5024/api/v2/payments` appear

## 3. State Management Integration Tests

### 3.1 PaymentProvider Wrapping ✅

**Test:** Verify Payments route is wrapped with PaymentProvider

**Steps:**
1. Inspect `src/Frontend/ai-admin-dashboard/src/App.tsx`
2. Find `/dashboard/payments` route definition
3. Verify it's wrapped with `<PaymentProvider>` and `<PaymentErrorBoundary>`

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Route wrapped with `<PaymentErrorBoundary>`
- ✅ Route wrapped with `<PaymentProvider>`
- ✅ Order: ErrorBoundary → PaymentProvider → Payments

**Status:** [ ] Not Tested | [ ] Passed | [ ] Failed

**Actual Code:**
```typescript
// From App.tsx
{
  path: 'payments',
  element: (
    <PaymentErrorBoundary showDetails={process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'}>
      <PaymentProvider>
        <Payments />
      </PaymentProvider>
    </PaymentErrorBoundary>
  )
}
```

---

### 3.2 PaymentContext State Sharing (Future)

**Test:** Verify PaymentContext shares state across components

**Note:** This test requires multiple components using `usePayment()` hook. Since we only have `Payments.tsx` currently, this test can be deferred to Phase 2 when we add Provider Management UI.

**Status:** [ ] Deferred to Phase 2

---

## 4. Idempotency Integration Tests

### 4.1 Idempotency Key Generation ✅

**Test:** Verify idempotency keys are generated for operations

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools (Network tab)
2. Trigger a refund operation (if backend supports it)
3. Check request headers or body for `idempotency_key` or `Idempotency-Key`

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Idempotency key is present in request
- ✅ Key format: `payment-{context}-{timestamp}-{uuid}`
- ✅ Key is unique for each operation

**Status:** [ ] Not Tested | [ ] Passed | [ ] Failed | [ ] Deferred (no refund data yet)

---

### 4.2 Duplicate Request Prevention ✅

**Test:** Verify duplicate requests are prevented

**Steps:**
1. Rapidly click refund button multiple times
2. Check Network tab for duplicate requests
3. Verify only one request is sent

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Request deduplication prevents multiple calls
- ✅ Or backend returns same response for duplicate idempotency key

**Status:** [ ] Not Tested | [ ] Passed | [ ] Failed | [ ] Deferred (no refund UI yet)

---

## 5. Database Integration Tests

### 5.1 Payment Tables Exist ✅

**Test:** Verify payment tables exist in database

**Steps:**
```bash
PGPASSWORD=weedgo123 psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U weedgo -d ai_engine -c "\dt payment*"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 6 tables exist:
  - payment_transactions
  - payment_providers
  - store_payment_providers
  - payment_methods
  - payment_refunds
  - payment_webhooks
- ✅ 0 orphaned tables (cleaned up in Phase 1.11.5)

**Status:** [ ] Not Tested | [ ] Passed | [ ] Failed

**Notes:**
```
Tables found:
-
```

---

### 5.2 Test Data Exists (Optional)

**Test:** Check if any payment data exists

**Steps:**
```bash
PGPASSWORD=weedgo123 psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U weedgo -d ai_engine -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment_transactions;"
PGPASSWORD=weedgo123 psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U weedgo -d ai_engine -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment_providers;"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Queries execute without error
- ✅ Counts returned (even if 0)

- ✅ Page loads without errors
- ✅ Either:
  - Shows transaction list (if data exists)
  - Shows "No transactions found" empty state
- ✅ Metrics display correct values or defaults (0)

**Status:** [ ] Not Tested | [ ] Passed | [ ] Failed

**Notes:**
```
Store selected:
Data loaded: Yes / No
Errors:
```

---

### 6.2 Provider Configuration Workflow (Phase 2)

**Status:** [ ] Deferred to Phase 2 (no UI for adding providers yet)

---

### 6.3 Refund Workflow (Phase 2)

**Status:** [ ] Deferred to Phase 2 (requires backend V2 endpoints)

---

## 7. Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| V2 backend endpoints may not be fully implemented | High | API calls may fail | To verify |
| No test payment data in database | Medium | Cannot test transaction list | Expected |
| Provider management UI missing | Medium | Cannot configure providers | Phase 2 |
| Refund endpoint may not exist | Medium | Cannot test refund flow | Phase 2 |

---

## 8. Integration Test Results Summary

### ✅ What Works (Verified)

- [ ] Frontend builds without errors (Vite)
- [ ] Payments page loads without import errors
- [ ] Error boundary catches errors
- [ ] Route wrapped with PaymentProvider
- [ ] Database tables exist (6 active tables)
- [ ] Store context integration works

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Known Issues)

- [ ] V2 API endpoints not implemented yet
- [ ] No test data to display
- [ ] Provider management UI missing

### ⏳ What Needs Backend Work

- [ ] Backend V2 endpoints (POST /api/v2/payments/process, etc.)
- [ ] Provider health check endpoint
- [ ] Refund endpoint implementation
- [ ] Webhook receiver endpoint

---

## 9. Recommendations for Phase 2

Based on integration testing results:

1. **If API endpoints exist:**
   - ✅ Proceed with Phase 2.1 (Provider Management UI)
   - ✅ Add test data to database
   - ✅ Test end-to-end payment flow

2. **If API endpoints missing:**
   - ⚠️ Complete backend V2 implementation first
   - ⚠️ Or work on both frontend + backend in parallel
   - ⚠️ Use mock data in frontend until backend ready

3. **Critical for Phase 2:**
   - Provider CRUD endpoints must exist
   - Provider health check endpoint needed
   - Test connection functionality required
