- Calendar scheduling for consultations

#### 8. Scalability & Performance
**Current**: Single instance, local model
**Needed**:
- Distributed processing for high load
- Caching layer for frequent queries
- CDN for static assets
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Queue system for async processing
- Auto-scaling based on demand
