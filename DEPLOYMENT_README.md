# üöÄ WeedGo Triple-Environment Deployment System

## Overview

This repository includes a **production-ready, multi-cloud deployment strategy** across three independent environments: UAT, Beta, and Pre-PROD. Each environment runs on different hosting platforms to enable performance comparison, cost analysis, and built-in failover capabilities.

**Monthly Cost: $0-5** (vs $250+ on traditional cloud providers)

## üéØ Quick Start

### 1. Read the Documentation (5 minutes)

Start with these docs in order:

1. **[DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md](./DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md)** - Get all 3 environments live in ~2 hours
2. **[TRIPLE_ENVIRONMENT_DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md](./TRIPLE_ENVIRONMENT_DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md)** - Full strategic overview
3. **[DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md](./DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md)** - Detailed step-by-step procedures

### 2. Set Up GitHub Secrets (10 minutes)

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh

# Run interactive setup
./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh
```

This script will guide you through adding all required secrets to GitHub Actions.

### 3. Deploy Your First Environment (30 minutes)

Start with UAT:

```bash
# Deploy UAT environment
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh uat

# Check health
./scripts/health-check-all.sh
```

## üèóÔ∏è Environment Architecture

| Environment | Branch | Backend | Frontends | Database | Redis | Cost |
|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|------|
| **UAT** | `develop` | Koyeb | Cloudflare Pages | Neon | Upstash | $0 |
| **Beta** | `staging` | Render | Netlify | Supabase | Render | $0* |
| **Pre-PROD** | `release` | Railway | Vercel | Railway | Railway | $0-5 |

*Beta has limitations: Render services sleep after 15min idle, free DB expires in 90 days

---

## üîÑ Git Workflow

```
feature/* ‚Üí develop (UAT) ‚Üí staging (Beta) ‚Üí release (Pre-PROD) ‚Üí main (PROD)
              ‚Üì                 ‚Üì                  ‚Üì
         Auto-deploy      Auto-deploy        Auto-deploy
```

### Example: Adding a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-payment-method

# 2. Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new payment method"

# 3. Push and create PR to develop
git push origin feature/new-payment-method
gh pr create --base develop --title "Add new payment method"

# 4. After PR is merged, UAT auto-deploys
# Test in UAT environment

# 5. Promote to Beta
git checkout staging
git merge develop
git push  # Auto-deploys to Beta

# 6. Promote to Pre-PROD
git checkout release
git merge staging
git push  # Auto-deploys to Pre-PROD

# 7. When ready for production
git checkout main
git merge release
git push  # Production deployment (TBD strategy)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to specific environment
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh uat
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh beta
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh preprod

# Deploy to all environments
./scripts/deploy-environment.sh all
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check all environments
./scripts/health-check-all.sh

# Manual health check
curl https://weedgo-uat.koyeb.app/health
curl https://weedgo-beta.onrender.com/health
curl https://weedgo-preprod.up.railway.app/health
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Performance comparison across environments
cd src/Backend
python monitoring/environment_comparison.py
open environment_comparison.html

# Cost tracking and free tier monitoring
python monitoring/cost_tracker.py
open cost_tracking_report.html
```

### GitHub Actions

```bash
# View recent deployments
gh run list

# Watch current deployment
gh run watch

# Manually trigger deployment
gh workflow run deploy-multi-env.yml -f environment=uat
```

---

## üìä Monitoring Dashboards

### 1. Performance Comparison Dashboard

**File:** `environment_comparison.html` (generated by `environment_comparison.py`)

Shows:
- Response times across all 3 environments
- Success rates
- P95 latency
- Winner by category (fastest, most reliable)

**Run daily:**
```bash
cd src/Backend
python monitoring/environment_comparison.py
```

### 2. Cost Tracking Dashboard

**File:** `cost_tracking_report.html` (generated by `cost_tracker.py`)

Shows:
- Usage vs free tier limits for each platform
- Warnings when approaching limits (>80%)
- Recommendations for cost optimization
- Projected costs if free tiers exceeded

**Run weekly:**
```bash
cd src/Backend
python monitoring/cost_tracker.py
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Solutions

### UAT (Cloudflare + Koyeb + Neon)

**Limitation:** Neon free tier has 3GB storage limit

**Solution:**
- Monitor storage usage with alerts at 2.5GB (83%)
- Run `cost_tracker.py` weekly to track usage
- Plan for Neon Pro upgrade ($19/month) when needed

### Beta (Netlify + Render + Supabase)

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Render free services sleep after 15min idle (first request slow)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Render free PostgreSQL expires after 90 days
- Netlify has 100GB bandwidth limit

**Solutions:**
- Use external cron job to ping service every 10 min: `*/10 * * * * curl https://weedgo-beta.onrender.com/health`
- Use Supabase instead of Render PostgreSQL (no expiration)
- Monitor Netlify bandwidth in dashboard

### Pre-PROD (Vercel + Railway)

**Limitation:** Railway $5/month credit may exceed with heavy usage

**Solutions:**
- Monitor Railway usage dashboard weekly
- Set up billing alerts in Railway at $4/month
- Optimize database queries to reduce compute time
- Consider upgrading to Railway Pro if consistently exceeding

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "GitHub Actions failing to deploy"

1. Check secrets are configured: `https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Verify `.github/workflows/deploy-multi-env.yml` exists
3. Check GitHub Actions logs: `gh run view`

### "Backend health check failing"

1. Check platform-specific logs:
   - UAT: `koyeb service logs weedgo-uat-backend --follow`
   - Beta: Render dashboard ‚Üí Logs
   - Pre-PROD: `railway logs --service backend`

2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check database connection: `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"`

### "Frontend showing 404"

1. Verify build succeeded in GitHub Actions
2. Check platform-specific deployment logs
3. Redeploy manually if needed:
   ```bash
   cd src/Frontend/[app-name]
   npm run build
   # Then deploy to platform
   ```

### "Database connection refused"

1. Check if database is active in platform dashboard
2. Verify connection string in `.env.*` files
3. For Neon: Ensure `sslmode=require` in connection string
4. For Railway: Verify `DATABASE_URL` variable exists
