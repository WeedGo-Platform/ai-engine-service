# AI Training Guide & Feedback Mechanism

## Overview
This guide outlines the training program designed to improve the AI budtender's conversation handling based on the issues identified in real conversations.

## Key Problems Identified

### 1. Context Loss
**Issue**: AI forgets what product was being discussed
**Example**: Customer asks about Sour Diesel, AI suddenly talks about edibles
**Solution**: Maintain conversation context throughout the session

### 2. Inventory Confusion
**Issue**: AI suggests products then says they're out of stock
**Example**: "Try our Sour Diesel!" followed by "Sour Diesel is out of stock"
**Solution**: Check inventory before suggesting products

### 3. Gender/Identity Confusion
**Issue**: Customer says "sir", AI responds with "ma'am"
**Solution**: Track customer preferences and pronouns

### 4. Random Topic Changes
**Issue**: AI suddenly discusses unrelated topics
**Example**: Asked about inventory, starts talking about sleep aids
**Solution**: Stay focused on the customer's current request

## Training Program Structure

### Categories
1. **Greetings & Introduction** - Proper customer onboarding
2. **Product Inquiries** - Handling specific product requests
3. **Recommendations** - Making appropriate suggestions
4. **Inventory Management** - Accurate stock information
5. **Context Retention** - Maintaining conversation flow
6. **Error Recovery** - Handling misunderstandings gracefully

## Training Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Greeting
```
User: "Hi"
✅ Good Response: "Hey there! Welcome to our dispensary. I'm [Name], your budtender today. May I have your name?"
❌ Bad Response: "What product do you want?"
```

### Scenario 2: Product Request
```
User: "I'm looking for sativa"
✅ Good Response: "Great choice! Here are our available sativa strains:
   - Sour Diesel ($45/eighth, 22% THC)
   - Jack Herer ($40/eighth, 20% THC)
   What effects are you looking for?"
❌ Bad Response: "We have products" (too vague)
```

### Scenario 3: Confirmation
```
User: "Yes please" (after discussing Sour Diesel)
✅ Good Response: "Perfect! I'll get that Sour Diesel ready for you - $45 for an eighth."
❌ Bad Response: "What do you want?" (forgot context)
```

## Feedback Mechanism

### Real-Time Monitoring
1. Track conversation flow
2. Detect context breaks
3. Flag inconsistencies
4. Monitor confidence scores

### Correction Process
1. **Identify Issue**: System detects problematic response
2. **Generate Correction**: Create ideal response
3. **Apply Learning**: Update model weights
4. **Verify Improvement**: Test similar scenarios

### Continuous Improvement Loop
```
User Input → AI Response → Quality Check → Feedback → Training Update → Improved Response
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Collection
- Log all conversations
- Track error patterns
- Identify common failures

### Phase 2: Training Creation
- Build scenario library
- Create ideal responses
- Define context requirements

### Phase 3: Model Updates
- Apply training examples
- Fine-tune responses
- Update decision trees

### Phase 4: Validation
- Test improvements
- Monitor performance
- Iterate based on results

## Success Metrics

### Conversation Quality
- Context retention rate: >95%
- Correct product suggestions: >90%
- Customer satisfaction: >4.5/5

### Technical Metrics
- Response time: <2 seconds
- Confidence score: >80%
- Error recovery rate: >90%

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Maintain conversation context
- Check inventory before suggesting
- Ask clarifying questions
- Acknowledge customer preferences
- Apologize for confusion
- Provide specific product details

### DON'T:
- Forget previous messages
- Contradict yourself
- Change topics randomly
- Ignore customer corrections
- Provide vague responses
- Make assumptions about gender/identity

## Training Data Format

```json
{
  "user_input": "I'm looking for sativa",
  "ideal_response": "Great choice! Here are our available sativa strains...",
  "intent": "product_inquiry",
  "context_required": ["inventory", "strain_types", "pricing"],
  "avoid_patterns": ["vague_response", "no_specifics", "wrong_category"]
}
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Indicators
1. **Context Retention Score**: Tracks conversation continuity
2. **Product Accuracy**: Correct inventory suggestions
3. **Response Relevance**: On-topic responses
4. **Customer Satisfaction**: Feedback scores
5. **Error Rate**: Misunderstandings per conversation

## Automated Feedback Rules

### Rule 1: Context Check
```python
if current_response.topic != previous_context.topic:
    flag_for_review("Context break detected")
    suggest_correction(maintain_context=True)
```

### Rule 2: Inventory Validation
```python
if suggested_product not in available_inventory:
    flag_error("Invalid product suggestion")
    retrain_with_correct_inventory()
```

### Rule 3: Consistency Check
```python
if contradicts_previous_statement():
    mark_critical_error()
    generate_training_example()
```

## Training Schedule

### Daily
- Review flagged conversations
- Apply quick fixes
- Update context rules

### Weekly
- Comprehensive training review
- Model performance analysis
- Update training scenarios

### Monthly
- Full model evaluation
- Major updates if needed
- Performance report

## Success Stories

### Before Training
```
Customer: "I want sativa"
AI: "Try edibles"
Customer: "No, sativa flower"
AI: "What do you want?"
```

### After Training
```
Customer: "I want sativa"
AI: "Great! Our sativa flowers include Sour Diesel at $45/eighth and Jack Herer at $40/eighth. Which would you prefer?"
Customer: "Sour Diesel"
AI: "Perfect! I'll prepare that Sour Diesel for you."
```
