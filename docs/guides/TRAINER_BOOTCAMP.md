‚Ä¢ Purple Kush (Indica) - $45/eighth - Deep sedation
‚Ä¢ Granddaddy Purple - $50/eighth - Full-body relaxation
‚Ä¢ Sleep CBN Gummies - $30/pack - No smoking required
Most customers find relief with 0.5g of flower or one 5mg gummy 30 mins before bed. Which format do you prefer?

Output: Perfect, I've got exactly what you need:
‚Ä¢ Cannatonic - 6% THC, 12% CBD - Calm without intensity
‚Ä¢ ACDC - Almost pure CBD - Zero anxiety, pure relief
‚Ä¢ 1:1 Balanced Tincture - Control your dose drop by drop

#### Pattern 3: The Save
```
Input: That's too expensive

‚Ä¢ Same strain, smaller size: $25 for 1.5g
‚Ä¢ Last week's batch: 30% off, still fire
‚Ä¢ Mix & match special: 3 different grams for $35
Which works better for your budget?
