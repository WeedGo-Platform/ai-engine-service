# üéØ Joint Recognition Training Guide

## Teaching the AI: "Joint" = 1g Pre-Roll

### Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for training the AI to understand that when customers ask for a "joint", they're looking for 1g pre-rolls. The AI will learn to:
- Recognize "joint" and related slang terms
- Return only 1g pre-rolls (not other sizes)
- Provide plant type breakdown (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid)
- Offer smart quick actions for sales conversion

---

## üìä Current System State

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Products table contains pre-rolls with these key fields:
sub_category: 'Pre-Rolls'
size: '1x1g' or '1g'  -- These are joints!
plant_type: 'Indica Dominant', 'Sativa Dominant', 'Hybrid', 'Blend'
```

### Current Inventory (as of training):
- **Total 1g joints:** 160 products
- **Indica Dominant:** 72 products ($3.25-$11.08)
- **Sativa Dominant:** 48 products ($3.25-$10.12)
- **Hybrid:** 37 products ($3.65-$10.87)
- **Blend:** 3 products ($3.76-$7.59)

```

### Step 3: Test in Chat Interface

1. **Open the chat interface:**
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:5174/
   ```

2. **Test these queries:**

   **Basic Joint Request:**
   ```
   User: "give me a joint"
   
   Expected AI Response:
   "I have 160 pre-rolled joints (1g) available:
   
   ‚Ä¢ Indica Dominant: 72 options | Sativa Dominant: 48 options | 
     Hybrid: 37 options | Blend: 3 options
   ‚Ä¢ Price range: $3.25 - $11.08
   
   What type are you looking for?"
   
   Quick Actions:
   [Show indica joints] [Show sativa joints] [Filter by price] [High THC options]
   ```

   **Plant Type Specific:**
   ```
   User: "show me indica joints"
   
   Expected AI Response:
   "I have 72 Indica Dominant pre-rolled joints (1g) available:
   
   ‚Ä¢ Price range: $3.25 - $11.08
   ‚Ä¢ Average price: $6.45
   
   Would you like to:
   - See specific brands
   - Filter by THC content
   - View customer favorites
   - Check current deals"
   ```

   **Price-Based Query:**
   ```
   User: "what's your cheapest joint"
   
   Expected AI Response:
   "Our most affordable joints start at $3.25. These are quality 
   1g pre-rolls at great prices. Interested in seeing what's available?"
   ```

   **Slang Recognition:**
   ```
   User: "got any j's"
   
   Expected AI Response:
   [Same as basic joint request - AI understands slang]
   ```

### Step 4: Verify in Decision Tree Visualizer

1. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:5174/unified-training
2. **Click on** "AI Decision Tree Visualizer"
3. **Enter query:** "give me a joint"
4. **Click** "Analyze"

**Expected Visualization:**
- **Intent Detection:** product_inquiry (100% confidence)
- **Entities Extracted:** 
  - product_type: "joint"
  - sub_category: "Pre-Rolls"
  - size: "1g"
- **Product Search:** Triggered with correct criteria
- **Response Generation:** Includes count, plant types, price range
