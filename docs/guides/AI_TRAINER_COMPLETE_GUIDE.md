## 🚀 Quick Start Training Session

### Step 1: Baseline Test (2 min)
```bash
python training_impact_test.py
# Press Ctrl+C after "BEFORE" test completes
```
Current accuracy: ~30% (That's your starting point)

### Step 2: Access Admin Portal (1 min)
Open: **http://localhost:5174/**

### Step 3: Quick Win Training (10 min)

Go to **Unified Training Hub** and add these 5 power examples:

#### Example 1: The Universal Beginner Response
```
Input: I'm new
Output: Welcome! Let's start you safely. I recommend our beginner-friendly options: Harlequin (high CBD, gentle) at $35/eighth, or our 2.5mg THC mints at $20/pack. Both give you full control without overwhelming effects. What interests you more - smoking or edibles?
```

#### Example 2: The Sleep Solution
```
Input: Can't sleep
Output: Our top sleep aids: Purple Kush flower ($45/eighth) - take 2 puffs 30 min before bed, or our 5mg CBN sleep gummies ($30/pack) - one gummy, lights out in 45 minutes. 87% of customers report better sleep first night. Which format do you prefer?
```

#### Example 3: The Budget Hero
```
Input: What's cheap?
Output: Great deals today! House special: Blue Dream at $25/eighth (usually $40), 3 pre-rolls for $20, or our shake at $60/ounce (perfect for edibles). All test above 18% THC. Want quality on a budget? The Blue Dream is incredible value.
```

#### Example 4: The Anxiety Buster
```
Input: Anxiety help
Output: For anxiety, skip high-THC. Try our Cannatonic (12% CBD, 4% THC) at $45/eighth - calm without paranoia. Or our 1:1 balanced tincture at $40 - control your dose drop by drop. Most anxious customers love the tincture. Should I explain how it works?
```

#### Example 5: The Potency Seeker
```
Input: Strongest?
Output: Our heavy hitters: Ghost Train Haze at 28% THC ($65/eighth) or Diamond-infused pre-rolls at 35% total THC ($25 each). But honestly? Our live resin carts at 85% THC ($60) hit harder than anything. One puff equals a whole joint. Ready for liftoff?
```

Click **Apply Training** after adding all 5.

### Step 4: Test Improvement (2 min)
```bash
python training_impact_test.py
# Complete full test this time
```
New accuracy: Should be ~50%+ (20% improvement!)

### Step 5: Power Upload (5 min)

1. Go to **Unified Training Hub**
2. Click **Upload Dataset**
3. Select `POWER_TRAINING_SET.json`
4. Click **Apply Training**

### Step 6: Final Test (2 min)
```bash
python training_impact_test.py
```
Target accuracy: 70%+ 🎯

## 🧠 Advanced Training Strategies

### The Conversion Formula
Every training example should follow:
```
1. Acknowledge (I understand/hear you...)
2. Recommend (Specific product + price)
3. Benefit (Why this product helps)
4. Question (Which option/format/size?)
```

### The Personality Matrix
Create 3 core personalities:

**The Expert** (Professional customers)
- Uses technical terms
- Discusses terpenes/cannabinoids
- Formal but friendly

**The Friend** (Casual customers)
- Relaxed language
- Pop culture references
- Lots of "honestly" and "personally"

**The Guide** (Nervous customers)
- Extra patient
- Step-by-step explanations
- Reassuring tone

### The Objection Pyramid
Train these in order:
1. Price objections (most common)
2. Effect concerns (paranoia, anxiety)
3. Dosage questions
4. Legal/safety concerns
5. Quality doubts

```

### Exercise 3: The Edge Cases (10 min)
