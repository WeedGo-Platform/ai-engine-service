## Overview

- **High-Risk Signups**: Unusual patterns or suspicious activity
- **Bulk Signups**: Multiple accounts from same organization

### Verification Tiers

| Tier | Description | Review Required |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Auto-Approved** | Email domain matches CRSA website | ‚ùå No |
